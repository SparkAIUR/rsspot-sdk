Contributions should keep SDK behavior, CLI UX, and docs in sync.

## Contribution Checklist

1. Implement code change in `src/rsspot/*` with typed models/services as needed.
2. Update docs pages impacted by user-visible behavior changes.
3. Add or extend tests in `tests/` for the changed behavior.
4. Validate locally before opening PR.

## Local Validation Commands

```bash
uv run ruff check src tests
uv run mypy src
uv run pytest -q
npx sparkify doctor
```

Use `npx sparkify dev` for docs UX checks and navigation verification.

## PR Expectations

- Clear problem statement and behavior impact
- Linked evidence (test updates, command output snippets, screenshots for docs UX changes)
- No secret material in examples or committed config
- Coherent API lifecycle updates when schema or endpoint behavior changes
- For docs deployment behavior, keep [Deployment](/deployment) aligned with workflow changes.

## Docs Standards For This Repo

- Write task-oriented pages for external SDK users first.
- Keep internals pages explicit about when maintainers should read them.
- Keep commands copy/paste ready and mapped to real source behavior.
- Use [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting) for operational recovery guidance.
